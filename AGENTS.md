# Project Development Specification

This instructions file outlines the development, UI theme specification, deployment, and architecture of the current project.

## Before Implementing the User Intent
- Create a `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file in the root directory if it does not exist.
- Always check the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file for current implementation status or to give understanding about the codebase.
- Always follow the project specification written on `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## After Implementing the User Intent
- Update the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file to reflect the changes made. But only write the necessary information. Because that file will be use for context understanding in the future.
- Do not write unnecessary information or code snippets.
